## Overview

TAP is a drop-in replacement to the Scalar payment system currently in place. It provides the following key features:

Efficiently handles micropayments.
Adds a layer of consolidations to on-chain transactions and costs.
Allows Indexers control of receipts and payments, guaranteeing payment for queries.
It enables decentralized, trustless gateways and improves indexer-service performance for multiple senders.

## Specifics

TAP allows a sender to make multiple payments to a receiver, TAP Receipts, which aggregates these payments into a single payment, a Receipt Aggregate Voucher, also known as a RAV. This aggregated payment can then be verified on the blockchain, reducing the number of transactions and simplifying the payment process.

## Test

For each query, the gateway will send you a signed receipt that is stored on your database. Then, these queries will be aggregated by a tap-agent through a request. Afterwards, you’ll receive a RAV. You can update a RAV by sending it with newer receipts and this will generate a new RAV with an increased value.
